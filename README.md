# HomeCook'd

The following is a repo for HomeCook'd, Your Meal Away From Home. This was presented on June 29th, 2017 during Wyncode's Pitch Day XV.

With the growing rise in popularity of AirBnB, I asked myself "If Hosts are comfortable allowing Guests to rent out spaces in their own homes, why not rent out a space at their own dinner table?"

Introducing HomeCook'd, Users can sign up as either a Guest or Host. Hosts can put up their homecooked meals up for sale and Guests can reserve those meals. 


Future features include: 
```
Payment with Stripe
Facebook Integration
and 
more!
```

HomeCook'd was made using the Ruby on Rails framework, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, JavaScript


## Required 

In order to allow real-time messages, while in the homecookd folder and in a separate terminal, run the following command:
